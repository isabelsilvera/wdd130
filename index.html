            <p>Greetings! My name is Isabel, but feel free to address me as Isa, Bella, or Belle. I'm 33 and originally from Uruguay, a country famous for its soccer players and Mate. While I was born in "La ciudad de Treinta y Tres"(Thirty-Three City and yes the name of the City is a number), I've resided in Melo since I was only two weeks old.</p>
            <p> In my spare time, I enjoy indulging in various hobbies such as reading, listening to music, and playing with my furry companion Tommy. I'm typically a chill and introverted person who prefers deep conversations in serene environments. </p>
            <p>I'm a former teacher, but the taxing nature of the profession took a toll on my well-being, which led me to pursue a new path as an online student at BYU-Idaho with the aspiration of becoming a software engineer. </p>
            <p>Some of my hobbies include solving Rubik's cubes, practising lettering, watching movies, and collecting coins from around the globe.</p>
            <p>I'm excited to meet all of you and chat about anything and everything. Feel free to reach out to me on MS Teams or Canvas.</p>
            <p>Let's make this semester a memorable one!</p>
